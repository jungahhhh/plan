  <p>Coding is the primary method for allowing intercommunication between humans and machines.</p><p>Early coding was done through physical punch cards and similar methods.</p><p>As digital computers were created, early programming languages like BASIC, FORTRAN and COBOL were used, each with its own syntax and operators.</p><p>In the personal computer and Internet age, developers and computer programmers typically produce code in modules that correspond to individual computing tasks. These modules are put together in a collective framework or project, such as an individual software application.</p><p>Since these projects are usually more complex, professionals have established many more conventions and strategies for computer coding in order to make finished products more stable and functional.</p>
